To use the Master's thesis template with Lyx, follow these steps:
(with thanks to Philipp Hoppermann)

1.  Get the reportMaster.cls from Eleum.
2.  Create a folder "um-thesis" in /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/ 
3.  Copy reportMaster.cls to /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/reportUMMasterAI.cls
4.  Update Latex database: run "texhash" from command line 
5.  Create reportUMMasterAI.layout in ~/.lyx/layouts, insert the following lines:
    # \DeclareLaTeXClass[reportUMMasterAI]{report (UM Master AI Thesis)} Input report.layout 
6.  Start LyX and choose "Tools" > "Reconfigure". Close Lyx.
7.  Restart LyX. The new layout should be accessible in  "Document" > "Settings" > "Document class" as "report (UM Master AI Thesis)"
8.  Add the following lines to your Latex preamble (in "Document" > "Settings"):
    \title{Hide and Seek Games}
    \author{P.G.A.M.G.\ Uyttendaele}
    \id{DKE 09-16}
    \nameMastersProgramme{Artificial Intelligence}
    (or \nameMastersProgramme{Data Science for Decision Making})
    \committee{Dr. F. Thuijsman \\ Dr. J. Derks}

Note: The current date will be added automatically. Title and author can also be set in the document directly.

Namings (e.g. reportUMMasterAI.cls) can of course be changed as desired. It should also be possible to place the .cls file in  ~/texmf/tex/latex/ if one does not have root privileges.
