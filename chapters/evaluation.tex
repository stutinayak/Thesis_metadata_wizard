\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:eval}

To evaluate the results we download all the disease names from MeSH~\footnote{\url{http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MESH/?p=classes&conceptid=root}} and do a direct matching. In total there are $1615$ diseases identified in the NCBI disease corpus, when we try to find these terms in the disease names downloaded from MeSH, only $606$ were found which is approximately $37\%$ of the whole set. In the table~\ref{table: match} some examples are presented which were found in the MeSH ontology terms. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Examples of matches found}
\label{table: match}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Annotated Disease Name & Exact Match using regex \\ \hline
DM                     & DM                      \\ \hline
breast cancer          & breast cancer           \\ \hline
cancer                 & cancer                  \\ \hline
tumor                  & tumor                   \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the table~\ref{table:no_matches} some examples for no matches, whereas they were classified correctly using the deep learning classification model. 
\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Examples of no match with correct classification}
\label{table:no_matches}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Annotated Disease Name    & No Match using regex      & Identified using NN \\ \hline
pilomatricomas            & pilomatricomas            & Specific Disease    \\ \hline
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA & Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA & Specific Disease    \\ \hline
inherited ataxias         & inherited ataxias         & Disease Class       \\ \hline
mucosal lesions           & mucosal lesions           & Specific Disease    \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

After looking at the no matches it can be seen that just a simple search and find brute force method would not give the best results.
