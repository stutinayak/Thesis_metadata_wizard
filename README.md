Thesis document for automatic prediction of Biomedical Metadata using scientfic plublications.

## Abstract
While there exists an abundance of open biomedical data, the lack of high quality
metadata makes it challenging for others to nd relevant datasets and to reuse
them for another purpose. In particular, metadata are useful to understand
the nature and provenance of the data. A common approach to improving the
quality of metadata relies on expensive human curation, which itself is time
consuming and also prone to error. Towards improving the quality of metadata
we use scientic publications to automatically predict metadata key: value. For
prediction, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional
Long-short term memory network (BiLSTM). Additionally, we also perform a
comparison with multi-label classication methods. The best results we get are
from CNN. We focus our attention on the NCBI Disease Corpus.
